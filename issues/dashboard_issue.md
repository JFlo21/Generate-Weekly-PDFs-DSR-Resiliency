## Enhancement Request: Real-Time System Health Dashboard

### Business Case
- **Problem**: Manual checking of logs and system status creates delay in issue detection and consumes significant time
- **Impact**: System administrators, management, and stakeholders who need real-time visibility
- **Priority**: High
- **Timeline**: Needed within 2-3 weeks for immediate monitoring improvements

### Technical Specification
- **Scope**: Web dashboard, metrics collection, real-time updates, visualization components
- **Dependencies**: Flask/FastAPI framework, Chart.js, WebSocket infrastructure
- **Breaking Changes**: None - additive functionality only
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, UI tests

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Set up web framework and basic dashboard structure
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Implement metrics collection and storage
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Add real-time updates and visualizations
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Mobile responsiveness and export capabilities

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Low - well-established technologies and patterns
- **Business Risk**: Low - non-disruptive addition to existing system
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Incremental development with regular stakeholder feedback

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 50% reduction in manual system status checks
- [ ] < 2 second dashboard load time
- [ ] 99% uptime for dashboard service
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design working on all major devices
- [ ] Real-time updates with < 5 second latency

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Web dashboard accessible via HTTP server
- [ ] Real-time display of system health metrics (API usage, processing time, error rates)
- [ ] Visual representation of audit findings and anomalies
- [ ] Historical trend charts for key performance indicators
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design for remote monitoring
- [ ] Auto-refresh capabilities with configurable intervals
- [ ] Status indicators (green/yellow/red) for quick assessment
- [ ] Export capabilities for management reports

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Flask/FastAPI web framework implementation
- [ ] Chart.js or similar for data visualizations
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [ ] Integration with existing health check system
- [ ] Responsive CSS framework (Bootstrap/Tailwind)
- [ ] REST API endpoints for data access
- [ ] Configuration management for dashboard settings

### Dependencies
- System health validation framework (already exists)
- Metrics collection infrastructure (needs implementation)
- Web server hosting capability
- Network access for real-time updates
