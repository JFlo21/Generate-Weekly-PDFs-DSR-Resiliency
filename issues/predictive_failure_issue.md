## Enhancement Request: Predictive Failure Detection and Prevention

### Business Case
- **Problem**: Reactive approach to system failures leads to unexpected downtime and emergency fixes
- **Impact**: Proactive maintenance, reduced downtime, better resource planning
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Timeline**: Needed within 3-4 weeks for proactive maintenance capabilities

### Technical Specification
- **Scope**: ML models, feature engineering, prediction engine, maintenance recommendations
- **Dependencies**: Historical data, ML infrastructure, feature collection pipeline
- **Breaking Changes**: None - additive predictive capabilities
- **Testing Strategy**: Model validation, prediction accuracy tests, false positive analysis

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Data collection and feature engineering
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Model development and training
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Prediction engine and alert integration
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Maintenance recommendation system

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Medium - ML model accuracy and feature selection challenges
- **Business Risk**: Medium - false predictions could lead to unnecessary maintenance
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Conservative thresholds, human review, continuous model improvement

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 80% prediction accuracy for major failures
- [ ] 60% reduction in unexpected system downtime
- [ ] 2-week advance warning for critical issues
- [ ] < 20% false positive rate
- [ ] 90% stakeholder confidence in predictions

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Collection of leading failure indicators
