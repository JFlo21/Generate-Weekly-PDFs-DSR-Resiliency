## Enhancement Request: Automated Performance Baseline Monitoring

### Business Case
- **Problem**: Manual performance reviews are time-consuming and reactive
- **Impact**: Proactive performance optimization, early degradation detection
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Timeline**: Needed within 1-2 weeks for immediate performance insights

### Technical Specification
- **Scope**: Metrics collection, statistical analysis, anomaly detection, performance reporting
- **Dependencies**: Metrics storage, statistical libraries, monitoring infrastructure
- **Breaking Changes**: None - additive monitoring capabilities
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, performance tests, statistical validation

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Implement comprehensive metrics collection
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Statistical baseline establishment
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Anomaly detection and alerting
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Performance recommendations and reporting

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Low - well-established monitoring patterns
- **Business Risk**: Low - non-disruptive performance insights
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Conservative thresholds, gradual rollout, validation against known issues

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 80% reduction in manual performance reviews
- [ ] Early detection of 95% of performance issues
- [ ] 30% improvement in system optimization response time
- [ ] < 10% false positive rate for performance alerts
- [ ] 90% accuracy in performance predictions

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated collection of performance metrics (processing time, memory usage, API response times)
- [ ] Statistical analysis to establish dynamic baselines
- [ ] Automatic detection of performance anomalies
- [ ] Trend analysis and projection capabilities
- [ ] Performance recommendations based on historical data
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Configurable thresholds and sensitivity levels
- [ ] Historical performance reporting

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Metrics collection framework using psutil and custom timers
- [ ] Statistical analysis libraries (scipy, numpy)
- [ ] Time series database for metric storage
- [ ] Anomaly detection algorithms
- [ ] Reporting engine for automated summaries
- [ ] Dashboard integration
- [ ] Alert integration

### Dependencies
- Metrics storage infrastructure
- Historical data for baseline establishment
- Performance monitoring tools
- Statistical analysis libraries
