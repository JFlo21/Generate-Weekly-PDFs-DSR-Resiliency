## Enhancement Request: Intelligent Alert Routing and Escalation System

### Business Case
- **Problem**: Alert fatigue from too many notifications, critical issues get lost in noise, manual triage required
- **Impact**: Faster response to critical issues, reduced interruptions for non-critical alerts
- **Priority**: High
- **Timeline**: Needed within 2-3 weeks to improve incident response

### Technical Specification
- **Scope**: Alert classification engine, routing rules, escalation system, multiple notification channels
- **Dependencies**: Notification providers (email, Slack, SMS), rule engine, user directory
- **Breaking Changes**: None - enhances existing alerting
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, notification tests, escalation simulation

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Design rule engine and classification system
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Implement routing and notification infrastructure
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Add escalation rules and tracking
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Integration testing and configuration management

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Medium - complex rule engine and integration points
- **Business Risk**: Medium - incorrect routing could delay critical responses
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Extensive testing, gradual rollout, manual override capabilities

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 70% reduction in false positive alerts
- [ ] < 5 minute response time for critical issues
- [ ] 90% alert resolution without escalation
- [ ] 100% delivery rate for critical alerts
- [ ] User satisfaction score > 8/10

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automatic issue classification (critical, warning, info)
- [ ] Smart routing based on issue type and expertise areas
- [ ] Escalation rules with time-based triggers
- [ ] Multiple notification channels (email, Slack, SMS)
- [ ] Alert suppression for known issues during maintenance
- [ ] Business hours vs after-hours handling rules
- [ ] Alert correlation to reduce noise
- [ ] Automated acknowledgment tracking

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Rule engine for alert classification and routing
- [ ] Integration with multiple notification providers
- [ ] Database for alert history and escalation tracking
- [ ] Configuration management for routing rules
- [ ] API endpoints for external integrations
- [ ] Web interface for rule management
- [ ] Analytics and reporting capabilities

### Dependencies
- Notification service providers (Slack, email, SMS)
- User role and responsibility definitions
- Business rules documentation
- Integration with existing monitoring systems
