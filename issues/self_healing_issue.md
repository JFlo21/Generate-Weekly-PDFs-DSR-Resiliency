## Enhancement Request: Self-Healing API Error Recovery System

### Business Case
- **Problem**: Manual intervention required for common API failures, rate limiting, and transient errors
- **Impact**: Reduced downtime, improved reliability, less manual monitoring required
- **Priority**: High
- **Timeline**: Needed within 2-3 weeks to improve system reliability

### Technical Specification
- **Scope**: Retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, rate limiting, error classification, recovery strategies
- **Dependencies**: Smartsheet API documentation, error classification framework
- **Breaking Changes**: None - enhances existing error handling
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests, integration tests, failure simulation, recovery validation

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Implement intelligent retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Add circuit breaker pattern and rate limit detection
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Create error classification and recovery strategies
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Add self-diagnostics and monitoring

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Medium - complex error handling and state management
- **Business Risk**: Medium - improper recovery could mask real issues
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Comprehensive logging, manual override, gradual rollout

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 90% reduction in manual intervention for API errors
- [ ] 95% automatic recovery rate for transient failures
- [ ] < 10 second average recovery time
- [ ] Zero data loss during recovery operations
- [ ] 100% recovery attempt logging

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Intelligent retry with exponential backoff and jitter
- [ ] Rate limit detection and automatic throttling
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
- [ ] Automatic failover to backup strategies
- [ ] Error pattern recognition and appropriate responses
- [ ] Self-diagnostics and automatic correction
- [ ] Recovery attempt logging and success tracking
- [ ] Manual override capabilities for edge cases

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Retry decorator with configurable strategies
- [ ] Circuit breaker implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting detection algorithms
- [ ] Fallback mechanism framework
- [ ] Error classification and handling rules
- [ ] Recovery state management
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and metrics

### Dependencies
- Smartsheet API rate limits and error codes
- Existing error handling infrastructure
- Monitoring and alerting system
- Backup data access strategies
