## Enhancement Request: AI-Powered Audit Analysis Assistant

### Business Case
- **Problem**: Manual review of audit findings is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge
- **Impact**: Faster audit processing, consistent analysis, reduced manual oversight
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Timeline**: Needed within 4-6 weeks for audit efficiency improvements

### Technical Specification
- **Scope**: NLP analysis, classification models, recommendation engine, audit workflow integration
- **Dependencies**: Historical audit data, ML infrastructure, business rules documentation
- **Breaking Changes**: None - enhances existing audit process
- **Testing Strategy**: Model validation, accuracy tests, integration tests, user acceptance

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Data preparation and model development
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Classification and scoring implementation
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Recommendation engine development
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Audit workflow integration and feedback loop

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Medium - NLP accuracy and domain-specific understanding
- **Business Risk**: Medium - incorrect classifications could miss important issues
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Human review required, confidence scoring, continuous learning

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 70% reduction in manual audit review time
- [ ] 95% accuracy in anomaly classification
- [ ] 90% stakeholder confidence in AI recommendations
- [ ] < 5% false negative rate for critical issues
- [ ] 80% adoption rate by audit team
