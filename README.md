# 📄 Smartsheet Weekly PDF Generator Automation

This project automates the generation of **weekly PDF summaries** from Smartsheet data. It pulls rows grouped by `Foreman`, `Work Request #`, and `Weekly Referenced Logged Date`, fills out a PDF template using those values, calculates a total, and uploads the PDF back to the corresponding row on Smartsheet.

## 📂 Files

```plaintext
📄 generate_weekly_pdfs.py   # Main automation logic
📄 template.pdf              # Fillable form used for PDF generation
📄 requirements.txt          # Required Python packages
📁 .github/workflows/        # GitHub Actions automation (optional)
📁 docs/                     # React UI for browsing generated PDFs
```

The `docs` directory contains a small React application that loads the
`metadata.json` file and presents the generated PDFs in an interactive table.
The interface uses a Bootswatch theme for a clean look so billers and accountants
can quickly filter and open the weekly PDF files.
