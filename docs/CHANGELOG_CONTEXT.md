# Changelog Context

> **Canonical change ledger: [`memory-bank/living-ledger.md`](../memory-bank/living-ledger.md).**
> Append dated `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` entries there — this repo keeps the *what changed
> and why* narrative in the Living Ledger, not split across separate files.
>
> This stub exists so the global context-continuity write-back order (which names
> `docs/CHANGELOG_CONTEXT.md`) resolves to a real path. The Stop hook
> (`require_context_update_on_stop.js`) recognizes **both** this file and the Living
> Ledger, so updating either satisfies it.

## 2026-08-27 — pipeline_memory client init fixed for supabase-py sync options (PR #356)
First run after the `RUN_MEMORY_WRITE_ENABLED` flip wrote no run memory: the base
`ClientOptions` passed by the WR-02 timeout wiring lacks `.storage`, which supabase-py
2.31's sync `create_client` reads. `pipeline_memory/client.py` now builds
`SyncClientOptions`, falls back to a bare client if the SDK rejects options, and logs the
exception message; a real-SDK construction test guards it. Billing was never affected.
