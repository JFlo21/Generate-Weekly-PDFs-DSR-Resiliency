# Changelog Context

> **Canonical change ledger: [`memory-bank/living-ledger.md`](../memory-bank/living-ledger.md).**
> Append dated `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` entries there — this repo keeps the *what changed
> and why* narrative in the Living Ledger, not split across separate files.
>
> This stub exists so the global context-continuity write-back order (which names
> `docs/CHANGELOG_CONTEXT.md`) resolves to a real path. The Stop hook
> (`require_context_update_on_stop.js`) recognizes **both** this file and the Living
> Ledger, so updating either satisfies it.

## 2026-08-27 — pipeline_memory client init fixed for supabase-py sync options (PR #356)
First run after the `RUN_MEMORY_WRITE_ENABLED` flip wrote no run memory: the base
`ClientOptions` passed by the WR-02 timeout wiring lacks `.storage`, which supabase-py
2.31's sync `create_client` reads. `pipeline_memory/client.py` now builds
`SyncClientOptions`, falls back to a bare client if the SDK rejects options, and logs the
exception message; a real-SDK construction test guards it. Billing was never affected.
See `memory-bank/living-ledger.md` `[2026-08-27 11:51]`.

## 2026-08-27 — identity row = canonical row: Excel header + orchestrate Sites 1/2/3 (PR #361)
A helper group can hold rows from two departments (its key carries no dept/job). #359 made
the hash order-stable, but the workbook header and the three orchestrate identity sites
(main-loop `history_key`, `valid_wr_weeks`, `current_keys` prune) still read arrival-order
`group_rows[0]`, so a stable hash was looked up under an unstable key and the group could
regenerate every run. All of them now read `canonical_first_row()`; the sort key also carries
every Job # alias the header accepts and the legacy identity `User` (hash-neutral: both sit
after the hashed-field string).
Hashes are byte-identical to master; only mixed-dept helper groups get one final regeneration.
Declined: legacy-mode header determinism (rollback sort is frozen). Deferred to Juan: aligning
the header's foreman with the hash's first-nonempty `FOREMAN=` token (billing-output change).
See `memory-bank/living-ledger.md` `[2026-08-27 20:20]`.

## 2026-08-27 — Learn guides corrected against pipeline behaviour (PR #360 review round)
The new operator / engineer guides and the system overview copied several claims that the
code contradicts: the acceptance gate (WR + weekly date + Units Completed? + price > 0 in
`fetch.py:837`; CU / quantity / foreman do not gate), the group key (`(WR, week, variant,
claimer)` — dept/job never split a file), `wr_filter` (test-mode only, never attaches),
`reset_wr_list` (destructive and global), the real CDT/CST schedule windows and run times,
and where attribution freezes. All corrected with line anchors; `CLAUDE.md`'s six-field
grouping description carries the same drift and is a separate follow-up.
See `memory-bank/living-ledger.md` `[2026-08-27 21:10]`.
