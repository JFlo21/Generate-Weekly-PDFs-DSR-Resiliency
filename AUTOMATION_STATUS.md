# Automation Status - Weekly PDF Generation

## 🚀 **FIXED: Continuous Operation Every 2 Hours**

### Problem Identified
The GitHub Actions workflow was previously configured to:
- ✅ Run every 2 hours (`0 */2 * * *` cron schedule)
- ❌ **BUT** only execute during Sunday 5-10 PM Central Time window
- ❌ This meant the script would start every 2 hours but immediately skip execution unless it was Sunday evening

### Solution Implemented
**Removed Sunday-only restriction** - The script now runs every 2 hours, 24/7:

#### What Changed:
1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/weekly-excel-generation.yml`)
   - Removed time window check that limited execution to Sunday 5-10 PM
   - Changed from "weekly execution window" to "continuous monitoring"
   - Script now processes data updates whenever they occur
   - Maintains all existing functionality and safeguards

2. **Python Script** (`generate_weekly_pdfs.py`)
   - No changes needed - already designed for continuous operation
   - Date filtering logic is separate from execution timing
   - Sunday date calculations are for week-ending dates, not execution restrictions

#### What This Means:
- ✅ **Every 2 hours**: Script checks for new/updated data in Smartsheet
- ✅ **Automatic uploads**: Excel files are generated and uploaded when data changes
- ✅ **Always current**: Reports reflect the latest data within 2 hours
- ✅ **No manual intervention**: Fully automated monitoring and updating

## 📊 Current Configuration

### Execution Schedule
```
Every 2 hours: 12 AM, 2 AM, 4 AM, 6 AM, 8 AM, 10 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, 4 PM, 6 PM, 8 PM, 10 PM (UTC)
```

### Data Processing
- **Source Sheets**: 4 base sheets + their duplicates (automatically discovered)
- **Filtering**: Monday-Sunday snapshot dates within weekly ranges
- **Output**: Excel files with proper week-ending date formatting
- **Upload**: Automatic attachment to Smartsheet target sheet

### Monitoring
- **GitHub Actions**: View execution logs at `https://github.com/JFlo21/Generate-Weekly-PDFs-DSR-Resiliency/actions`
- **Test Mode**: Available for manual testing without uploading
- **Production Mode**: Automatically enabled for scheduled runs

## 🔧 Manual Testing
You can manually trigger the workflow at any time:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Continuous Excel Report Generation" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose test mode (true/false) and click "Run workflow"

## 📝 Next Steps
The automation is now active and will:
1. ✅ Run every 2 hours automatically
2. ✅ Check for data updates in Smartsheet
3. ✅ Generate and upload Excel files as needed
4. ✅ Maintain all existing date filtering and formatting

**No further action required** - the system is now running continuously as intended.
